# Covid-Analysis---Italy
Covid Analysis in Italy:
During the Data mangagement and visualization project, I learned to: 
- collect data autonomously from multiple heterogeneous sources and store them (often in streaming) on appropriate databases (such as MongoDB and SQL);   
- scrape online iterative graphs;
- perform statistical and graphic analysis of the collected data
